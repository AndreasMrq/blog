            <p>This is not a technical blog post, but something more social and personal. There are many people in my life that I called friends or even good friends at a certain point in my past. However, as it often is, it's hard to keep in touch with all the people in your life. Either I moved away or they moved away or both. You finish school or university, quit a job or have any other kind of minor or major change in your life. And as hard as I try to stay in touch with people that are important to me, I notice that a lot of them have slipped away from me to the point that I haven't heard of them in years.</p>
            <p>So what I'm trying to do for my personal days of advent this year (01.12. - 24.12.) is that I'll pick one person each day that I cared about in my past and try to get in touch with them. By calling them, sending them a message or something like that. I am calling this my <strong>advent of anti-alienation</strong> and I found it quite surprising how easily I could come up with 24 names for the list - people from my school, university, my past job.</p>
            <p> Let's try to care more for our social contacts and use the christmas days to reach out.</p>
