            <p><a href="https://github.com/casey/just">Just</a> is a command runner for linux and Windows. It's similar to make, but has easier syntax and simplifies some things (e.g. PHONY targets ...). </p>

            <p>The main Usecase I have for this is to document all the different build systems and CLI commands I need for different languages and frameworks. Of course I could also just write plain .sh scripts or write Makefiles. However, I think it's nicer to have a single file instead of different scripts at toplevel. I think Makefiles may actually be better, since make is installed on every Linux system by default. But the simplicity is currently a strong argument for me.</p>

            <p>Here is an example (for running a local webserver to preview this blog).</p>

            <pre>
<code class="language-md">
# Shows available recipes
default:
  just --list

# Run local server on Port 8000
serve:
  python3 -m http.server 8000
</code></pre>
            <p>Now running <code>just serve</code> runs the python server on Port 8000. I like to have the default job as first job, so if I run <code>just</code> in a directory with a justfile it lists all available recipes. Otherwise this would execute the top recipe.

That's all. Have fun.<p>
